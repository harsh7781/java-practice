Arrays are fundamental structures in Java that allow us to store multiple values of the same type in a single variable.
They are useful for storing and managing collections of data.
Arrays in Java are objects, which makes them work differently from arrays in C/C++ in terms of memory management.

For primitive arrays, elements are stored in a contiguous memory location.
For non-primitive arrays, references are stored at contiguous locations, but the actual objects may be at different locations in memory.
