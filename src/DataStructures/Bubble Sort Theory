Imagine you have a row of numbers written on pieces of paper, and you want to arrange them in ascending order (smallest to largest).

You decide to do this by comparing two numbers at a time and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.
You keep doing this again and again until everything is sorted.

This simple way of sorting is called Bubble Sort because the largest numbers slowly "bubble up" to their correct position, just like air bubbles rise to the surface of water. 💨💦

How Bubble Sort Works (Step-by-Step)
Let’s say we have this list of numbers:
[5, 3, 8, 4, 2]

We will compare and swap adjacent numbers if they are in the wrong order. Let’s go through it step by step!

Pass 1 (Largest Number Moves to the End)
We start from the left and compare each pair of numbers:

Step	Compare	  Swap?	            New List
1️⃣	    5 and 3	  ✅ Yes (swap)	     [3, 5, 8, 4, 2]
2️⃣	    5 and 8	  ❌ No	             [3, 5, 8, 4, 2]
3️⃣	    8 and 4	  ✅ Yes (swap)	     [3, 5, 4, 8, 2]
4️⃣	    8 and 2	  ✅ Yes (swap)	     [3, 5, 4, 2, 8]
Now, 8 is in its correct position at the end! 🎉

Pass 2 (Next Largest Number Moves Up)
Now, we repeat the process, but we ignore the last number (8) because it's already sorted.

Step	Compare	    Swap?	        New List
1️⃣	     3 and 5	❌ No	        [3, 5, 4, 2, 8]
2️⃣	     5 and 4	✅ Yes (swap)	[3, 4, 5, 2, 8]
3️⃣	     5 and 2	✅ Yes (swap)	[3, 4, 2, 5, 8]
Now, 5 is in its correct position! 🚀

Pass 3 (Sorting the Remaining Elements)
We ignore the last two numbers (5 and 8) and repeat:

Step	Compare	    Swap?	        New List
1️⃣	    3 and 4	    ❌ No	        [3, 4, 2, 5, 8]
2️⃣	    4 and 2	    ✅ Yes (swap)	[3, 2, 4, 5, 8]
Pass 4 (Final Pass)
Only two numbers left to check:

Step	Compare	    Swap?	        New List
1️⃣	    3 and 2	    ✅ Yes (swap)	[2, 3, 4, 5, 8]
Now, the list is fully sorted! ✅🎉


Key Points
✅ Worst Case Time Complexity: O(n^2)
✅ Best Case Time Complexity: O(n) (if already sorted)
✅ Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place sorting)
✅ Stable Sort: Yes (maintains relative order of equal elements)
