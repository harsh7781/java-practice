Imagine you have a row of numbers written on paper, and you want to arrange them in ascending order (smallest to largest).

Instead of bubbling up like in Bubble Sort, you decide to find the smallest number and place it in the correct position.

This sorting method is called Selection Sort because at each step, you select the smallest element and put it in its right place. 🏆

How Selection Sort Works (Step-by-Step)
Let’s say we have this list of numbers:
[5, 3, 8, 4, 2]

Step 1: Find the Smallest Number and Swap It
Scan the entire array and find the smallest number (2).
Swap 2 with the first element (5).
Original	        Find Min	    Swap
[5, 3, 8, 4, 2]	    Min = 2	        [2, 3, 8, 4, 5]
✅ Now, 2 is in its correct place!

Step 2: Find the Smallest Number in the Remaining List
Ignore the first element (2).
Find the smallest number in [3, 8, 4, 5] → It's 3.
No need to swap (already in the correct place).
Array State	            Min	    Swap?
[2, **3**, 8, 4, 5]	    3	    No
✅ Now, 3 is in its correct place!

Step 3: Find the Smallest Number in the Remaining List
Ignore 2 and 3, find the smallest in [8, 4, 5] → It's 4.
Swap 4 with 8.
Array State	            Min	        Swap
[2, 3, **8, 4, 5]	    4	        [2, 3, 4, 8, 5]
✅ Now, 4 is in its correct place!

Step 4: Find the Smallest Number in the Remaining List
Ignore 2, 3, 4, find the smallest in [8, 5] → It's 5.
Swap 5 with 8.
Array State	            Min     	Swap
[2, 3, 4, **8, 5]	    5	        [2, 3, 4, 5, 8]
✅ Now, 5 is in its correct place!

Step 5: Last Number is Already Sorted
Only 8 remains → No action needed!
🎉 Sorted List: [2, 3, 4, 5, 8] 🎉


Why Selection Sort is Slow?
🔴 It takes O(n²) time, which means for large lists, it’s very slow. 🚀
🔴 It doesn’t stop early, even if the list is already sorted.
🔴 Better sorting algorithms exist, like QuickSort and MergeSort.

✅ Good for small datasets or when swaps are costly.

Key Takeaways
✔ Simple to understand 😊
✔ Always makes the same number of swaps (n-1)
✔ Good for small lists but bad for large lists
✔ Unstable Sort (does not preserve order of equal elements)
