- Threads are lightweight subprocesses, representing the smallest unit of execution with separate paths.
- The main advantage of multiple threads is efficiency (allowing multiple things at the same time).
- For example, in MS Word, one thread automatically formats the document while another thread is taking user input.
- Additionally, multithreading ensures quick response, as other threads can continue execution even if one gets stuck, keeping the application responsive.
